### Contents of the folder: 
    I've created 5 sections: 9 AM, 10 AM, 12 PM, 2 PM, and 4 PM which are numbered in sequence. 
    /Sources/App folder contains my Student model and rest implementations.
    /Resources/Leaf contains all the Leaf templates. 
    I've used SQLite as my database. 

### The system does the following:
    Allows professor to view all of the sections: Visit the /list webpage to view the students sorted via sections.
    Allows professor to view students inside of the sections: Visit the /list webpage to view the sorted students list.
    Allows professor to add students to the section: Visit the homepage to Add students to sections.
    Allows professor to delete students from the section: Visit the homepage to Delete Student from sections.
